## 🧠 Customizing Agent Memory
By default, **Ethereal SDK** provides a simple memory system, but you can extend it to add persistence or complex data handling.

### 🔹 Example: Implementing Persistent Memory
```python
from openmeta.core.memory import Memory

class PersistentMemory(Memory):
    def save_to_file(self, filename="memory.json"):
        import json
        with open(filename, "w") as f:
            json.dump(self.storage, f)

    def load_from_file(self, filename="memory.json"):
        import json
        with open(filename, "r") as f:
            self.storage = json.load(f)
```
💡 **Usage:** Store and retrieve agent memory across sessions!

---

## 🔄 Creating Dynamic Workflows
Workflows allow agents to execute complex sequences of actions dynamically.

### 🔹 Example: Conditional Workflow Execution
```python
from openmeta.core.workflows import Workflow

def step1():
    return "Collecting data..."

def step2():
    return "Processing data..."

def conditional_step():
    return "Performing advanced analytics..."

steps = [step1, step2]
if True:  # Condition can be dynamically set
    steps.append(conditional_step)

workflow = Workflow(steps)
print(workflow.execute())
```
💡 **Use case:** Modify agent workflows based on external conditions or real-time data.

---

## 🌐 Real-Time API Integrations
Integrating with real-time APIs enables AI agents to interact dynamically with external services.

### 🔹 Example: Fetching Live Data
```python
from openmeta.integrations.external_api import ExternalAPI

api = ExternalAPI("https://api.example.com")
data = api.fetch_data("/live-endpoint")
print(data)
```
💡 **Use case:** Enable AI agents to access up-to-date information from online sources.

---

## 📌 Task Queue and Execution
Efficient task management is crucial for AI-driven applications. The `TaskQueue` module provides structured task handling with priority-based execution.

### 🔹 Example: Using TaskQueue for Prioritized Processing
```python
from openmeta.core.task_queue import TaskQueue

task_queue = TaskQueue()

task1 = {"id": 1, "priority": 2, "task_type": "analysis"}
task2 = {"id": 2, "priority": 1, "task_type": "data_cleaning"}

task_queue.add_to_queue(task1)
task_queue.add_to_queue(task2)
task_queue.process_queue()
```
💡 **Use case:** Manage and execute tasks based on priority.

### 🔹 Example: Task Execution Mechanism
```python
def execute_task(task: dict):
    print(f"Executing task {task['id']}...")
```
💡 **Use case:** Define custom execution logic for tasks in the queue.

---

## ⚡ Enhancing Performance
For large-scale applications, optimizing execution speed is crucial.

### 🔹 Example: Running Tasks in Parallel
```python
import concurrent.futures
from openmeta.core.agent import Agent
from openmeta.core.memory import Memory

def run_agent_task(task):
    memory = Memory()
    agent = Agent("ParallelAgent", memory)
    return agent.process_task(task)

tasks = ["Task A", "Task B", "Task C"]
with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
    results = list(executor.map(run_agent_task, tasks))

print(results)
```
💡 **Use case:** Run multiple agent processes in parallel to reduce execution time.
